# Getting Started with react app and firebase authentication

This project was bootstrapped with [Apollo Health](https://apollo-health-care-a3b2a.web.app/home).

## Apollo Health Care

- This is health care related website
- From here you will get to know about hospital related service
- Doctor's name
- medical treatment that we provide
- our contact details etc.
- you may register and get appointment also

### here I have used firebase authentication system
### I have deployed this site in firebase also

### I also have used bootstrap cdn, font-awsome cdn, react-bootstrap, react-router-dom etc.

### I also have used context Api,PrivateRoute, localApi for fake data
